Welcome to my RISD Graphic Design Degree Project, titled "In case of loss, please return to:". 

A short project description below:

Loss is our first lesson in mystery. It teaches us that not everything can be saved, stored, or held, that the systems we build—digital, emotional, logical—have limits; we learn that sometimes, what’s most human is what we cannot explain. Only in absence does something remain: love, longing, or just the shape of what once was. In case of loss, please return to: is an exploration of loss not as absence, but as a site of emotional residue—where love remains, even when what it once tethered itself to has faded.

Inspired by Craigslist’s lost & found and missed connections advertisement postings, this project seeks to create a space to gather those fragments, where people can share what they’ve lost, into a living collection of collective longing. You can leave something here, and maybe someone else will find it. You can find something here, and it may not be yours—but it may feel familiar. The archive grows with each entry, each act of surrender, each quiet attempt at holding on. This is for anyone who has ever left something behind or taken too soon and felt a little less whole. Only in loss do we recognise how precious it all was—and still is.

To lose is to live. And sometimes, to find is not to recover, but to discover—to stumble across what we didn’t know we were seeking. Or, perhaps, not all that is lost wants to be found. Maybe that’s what this is: a gathering of echoes, a quiet act of either remembering or letting go, a love letter to everything we couldn’t hold on to.
